    <h1>Eye Yay Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="platforms">Effective Date: 1 December 2025</p>
    <p class="platforms">Developer: Bucket Brigade Software Limited (New Zealand)</p>
    <p class="lead">
      Eye Yay is a media player designed to browse, stream, and save content from the Internet
      Archive. This policy explains what information the app handles, how it is stored, how
      anonymised telemetry is processed, and your rights as a user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eye Yay does not require an account, does not track you across other companies’ apps or
      websites, and does not collect personally identifiable information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Collected</h2>
    <p>No data collected is linked to your identity.</p>

    <h3>Diagnostics (Not Linked to You)</h3>
    <p>
      The app may generate anonymous diagnostic information to help identify technical problems and
      improve stability, such as error states or download failures. This diagnostic information is
      anonymised before transmission and cannot identify you or your device.
    </p>

    <h3>Search History (Not Linked to You)</h3>
    <p>
      In-app search terms are processed to perform searches. Some anonymous telemetry may include
      aggregated information about search behaviour to improve usability. These terms are not
      associated with your identity.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage Data (Not Linked to You)</h3>
    <p>
      Anonymous usage data may be collected to understand which features are used most frequently
      and to support performance improvements. This includes high-level information such as which
      screens are viewed or how often the app is opened. All such data is anonymised prior to
      transmission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Locally on your device, Eye Yay stores information such as playback position, favourites,
      your saved library, and cached media. This data is never used for tracking or profiling and
      is never linked to your identity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>
      Some user data may be stored in iCloud to keep your library, favourites, and related
      metadata consistent across your own devices signed in with the same Apple ID.
    </p>
    <p>Data synced through iCloud is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>encrypted in transit</li>
      <li>encrypted at rest</li>
      <li>associated only with your Apple ID within Apple’s infrastructure</li>
      <li>not shared with the app developer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may disable iCloud for Eye Yay at any time in your device settings.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Anonymised Telemetry</h2>
    <p>Eye Yay uses a privacy-focused analytics mechanism that sends fully anonymised events.</p>
    <p>This system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>removes all personal identifiers before transmission</li>
      <li>does not use device identifiers, IP addresses, or fingerprinting</li>
      <li>does not track you across apps</li>
      <li>aggregates data to improve feature quality and performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The developer cannot identify individual users or devices from this information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Eye Yay Uses Information</h2>
    <p>Eye Yay uses anonymised and local information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>improve app performance and reliability</li>
      <li>understand which features are most helpful</li>
      <li>refine search and navigation patterns</li>
      <li>
        support core functionality such as downloads, caching, playback resumption, and favourites
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Eye Yay does not use your information for advertising, profiling, or cross-app tracking.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Where Information Is Stored</h2>

    <h3>Local Data</h3>
    <p>
      Bookmarks, cached media, library entries, and downloads remain on your device. They are
      stored in Application Support and Caches directories managed by the operating system.
    </p>

    <h3>iCloud Data</h3>
    <p>
      Some user library data may be synced to your personal iCloud account if enabled. This data
      is not accessible to the developer.
    </p>

    <h3>Telemetry Data</h3>
    <p>
      Anonymous telemetry is transmitted without any identifying information and is stored in
      aggregated form only.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Eye Yay does not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sell data</li>
      <li>share any identifying data with third parties</li>
      <li>transfer personal information</li>
      <li>use advertising SDKs</li>
      <li>participate in any cross-app tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Only anonymised analytics events are transmitted, and none contain identifying information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Internet Archive (archive.org)</h3>
    <p>
      Eye Yay retrieves content directly from the Internet Archive. Your device communicates with
      archive.org servers, which are governed by their own privacy policy. Eye Yay does not send
      them personal information.
    </p>

    <h3>Anonymous Analytics Processor</h3>
    <p>
      An anonymised telemetry processor receives analytics events stripped of identifying
      information. The processor cannot identify you or your device.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>

    <h3>Clear Cache</h3>

    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Eye Yay relies on Apple’s secure sandboxing and iCloud infrastructure. Anonymous telemetry is
      processed in a way that prevents identification or re-identification.
    </p>

    <h2>Eye Yay Apple TV Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="platforms">Effective Date: 1 December 2025</p>
    <p>Developer: Bucket Brigade Software Limited (New Zealand)</p>
    <p>
      Eye Yay is a media player for browsing, streaming, and saving content from the Internet
      Archive. This Apple TV Privacy Policy explains what information the app handles on tvOS and
      how it is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eye Yay does not collect personally identifiable information. Eye Yay does not track you
      across other companies’ apps or websites.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Collected (Not Linked to You)</h3>
    <p>
      Eye Yay may collect certain categories of data. These are required by Apple’s Privacy
      Nutrition Label standards, and none of the data collected is linked to your identity.
    </p>

    <h4>Diagnostics</h4>

      improve app stability. This may include anonymised error events and performance indicators.
    </p>

    <h4>Usage Data</h4>

      Your in-app search terms may be processed anonymously to improve search reliability and
      usability. These terms are not associated with your identity.
    </p>

    <h3>Anonymised Telemetry</h3>
    <p>
      Eye Yay uses a privacy-focused analytics mechanism that sends fully anonymised events to help
      improve the app.
    </p>
    <p>The system:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>does not track you across apps</li>
      <li>stores only aggregated, non-identifying information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The developer cannot identify you or your device from these analytics.</p>

    <h3>iCloud Sync</h3>
    <p>
      If enabled on your Apple TV, iCloud may be used to sync certain user data — such as your
      library items and favourites — across your own devices signed in with the same Apple ID.
    </p>
    <p>iCloud sync is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>optional</li>
      <li>encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
      <li>managed entirely by Apple</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No iCloud data is accessible to the developer.</p>

    <h3>Local Data Stored on Your Apple TV</h3>
    <p>To provide core app features, Eye Yay stores the following locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your saved library items</li>
      <li>playback position (resume markers)</li>
      <li>favourites</li>
      <li>cached artwork and media for offline or smooth playback</li>
      <li>download progress information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is never transmitted in identifiable form and is controlled by you.
    </p>

    <h3>How Eye Yay Uses Information</h3>
    <p>Eye Yay uses local and anonymised information only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>resume playback</li>
      <li>support offline playback and caching</li>
      <li>display your library and favourites</li>
      <li>improve performance and app stability</li>
      <li>understand feature usage patterns in anonymous form</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
